Hi! My name is Taiga Momose. I'm a third year engineering physics student at UBC with an interest in mechatronics and aerospace. I love mountain biking, swimming, and geography and my favourite city
in the entire world is Victoria, BC! I am currently looking for an internship in mechanical engineering and would love to be able to do research and design as well as some hands-on work!
