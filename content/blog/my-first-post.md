Hey everyone! Welcome to my portfolio/personal website. I plan on using this place to showcase my projects, coursework, and some random blogs for all to see! I originally wanted to make my own website
completely from scratch, but struggled with my limited HTML/CSS skills to make one in time for the school term. 


I was instead recommended Hugo by my friends and was able to get this site up and running
within a day. I modified the template to include a separate page for projects and courses, and with that out of the way my next goal is to write about all the projects I've worked on recently!
